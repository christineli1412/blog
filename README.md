# A Blog App

By Christine Li

This blog app was created using React and is hosted on firebase. In order to view articles, users must first sign in through Google. Certain users are allowed to create articles. Changes to the blog will be saved when a user signs out or exits the tab.

Currently, there is no delete article functionality, and once users click the new article button, they must create an article in order to read other articles.
